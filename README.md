## Environment and Settings
* Download and install VC++6.0.
* Download and install [EasyX库 2012立冬版](http://www.easyx.cn/downloads/View.aspx?id=6). (If you cannot visit the download link, this repository has also provided the installation package, and you can just download from here.)
* Compile the source code file 'xxx.cpp' by VC, and then you can run and play the game.

## Key Points
* Use 3 identifiers to represent the status (empty, black cell and white cell) of each cell in chessboard.
* Design a Decision Algorithm to judge whether there's one side who has won the game at present.
